Q8.) What are types of casting?
Solution: a) Primitive casting: Here the data is casted from one primitive to another primitive type. 
 		  b) Derived casting: When data from on e derived type is casted to another derived type. 

Q9.) What is boxing and unboxing?
Solution: Wrapping a primitive content into corresponding wrapper class object called boxing. Unwrapping the wrapper class object into primitive content is called unboxing.

Q10.) What is the difference between keywords, identifiers and literals in Java?
Solution: a) Keywords: These are pre-defined words with a set meaning for the compiler and thus are used as identifiers.
